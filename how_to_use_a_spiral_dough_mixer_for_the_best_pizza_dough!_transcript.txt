# How to Use a Spiral Dough Mixer for the BEST Pizza Dough!

## Transcript
[0:00:00 - 0:00:03]: So today's video is very important for dough making.

[0:00:03 - 0:00:06]: It doesn't matter if you're making pizza dough, bread dough.

[0:00:06 - 0:00:11]: If you have a spiral mixer, I'm here to show you how to use it.

[0:00:11 - 0:00:12]: Now here are the ingredients.

[0:00:12 - 0:00:20]: I'm using sea salt, active dried yeast, Italian double-zero flour, cold water, and then

[0:00:20 - 0:00:23]: ice is the secret for mixing an spiral mixer.

[0:00:23 - 0:00:28]: And along with this ice, you will need an infrared thermometer to take the temperature

[0:00:28 - 0:00:31]: to your dough doesn't overheat.

[0:00:31 - 0:00:37]: So today I'm actually using a recipe where I'm utilizing old dough into my new dough.

[0:00:37 - 0:00:43]: So have you ever had dough that has been over-proved and wondered what could you do with it?

[0:00:43 - 0:00:47]: Well you can't really bake it, you can't turn it into anything.

[0:00:47 - 0:00:53]: However we could utilize it in our new dough to give it flavor, better coloring, and it

[0:00:53 - 0:00:55]: actually rises quicker.

[0:00:55 - 0:01:00]: Here's the recipe.

[0:01:00 - 0:01:06]: So I'm assuming most of you have the kitchen aid mixer at home, I used to use one until

[0:01:06 - 0:01:09]: it broke and I ran into many problems.

[0:01:09 - 0:01:14]: The first major issue is that the dough hook doesn't reach the bottom of the bowl, so maybe

[0:01:14 - 0:01:18]: in this case start out using the paddle attachment.

[0:01:18 - 0:01:24]: It'll mix the dough better at first and then you can switch over to the dough hook.

[0:01:24 - 0:01:32]: Anyways, we're going to add in the old dough first, all of the ice, half of the water,

[0:01:32 - 0:01:37]: because our first main objective is to mix the dough and bring it together to start building

[0:01:37 - 0:01:41]: the structure without adding all of the water.

[0:01:41 - 0:01:46]: Then I'm going to go in with the yeast, the flour, and finally the salt on top.

[0:01:46 - 0:01:52]: And we're going to start this mix out very low speed to bring that dough together until

[0:01:52 - 0:01:57]: you see it sticking to the center or your dough hook.

[0:01:57 - 0:02:04]: Now the ice plays the most important role in mixing pizza dough using a spiral mixer,

[0:02:04 - 0:02:10]: because the mixer creates friction, which causes the dough to warm up.

[0:02:10 - 0:02:13]: Right now I want the dough to come together.

[0:02:13 - 0:02:20]: Yes, it might look a little tough and less loose, but the idea is that the dough will start

[0:02:20 - 0:02:24]: out cold and we'll add in the water little by little to finish it off.

[0:02:24 - 0:02:30]: Now this is a technique used all over the world from professional bakeries to Neapolitan

[0:02:30 - 0:02:32]: Pizzerias.

[0:02:32 - 0:02:36]: Right now after four minutes of mixing at low speed, you can see that the dough has come

[0:02:36 - 0:02:37]: together.

[0:02:37 - 0:02:42]: Let's move it up to a medium speed and start to add in.

[0:02:42 - 0:02:48]: I only add in about two tablespoons of water at a time and each time I wait until the

[0:02:48 - 0:02:55]: dough comes back together into one mass before adding the next dosage.

[0:02:55 - 0:03:00]: If you wait till the end of this video, I will show you my exact times and dosages for

[0:03:00 - 0:03:02]: this recipe.

[0:03:02 - 0:03:05]: This means we could bring the mixer to a high speed.

[0:03:05 - 0:03:15]: Luckily this sun mix does 300 revolutions per minute.

[0:03:15 - 0:03:17]: So this is around the 9 minute mark.

[0:03:17 - 0:03:20]: The dough is looking almost smooth.

[0:03:20 - 0:03:25]: It's at a very low temperature which is good and it's becoming one.

[0:03:25 - 0:03:31]: In Italy they would call this la zucca or the pumpkin because as the dough mixes it cleans

[0:03:31 - 0:03:36]: to that pull in the center looking like a pumpkin shape.

[0:03:36 - 0:03:38]: And this is a great sign.

[0:03:38 - 0:03:40]: All of the water has just been added.

[0:03:40 - 0:03:51]: Now we can let the dough build the gluten structure until it becomes smooth and beautiful.

[0:03:51 - 0:03:53]: So it hit the 10 minute mark.

[0:03:53 - 0:03:54]: The dough is still mixing.

[0:03:54 - 0:03:59]: It did reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it looks pretty smooth already.

[0:03:59 - 0:04:02]: However, if the dough is moving at a fast rate, let it mix.

[0:04:02 - 0:04:08]: It's going to take very little time until it reaches 75 degrees Fahrenheit which is our final

[0:04:08 - 0:04:10]: dough temperature.

[0:04:10 - 0:04:13]: As you can see this infrared thermometer plays an important role.

[0:04:13 - 0:04:20]: However this sun mix has a thermometer built in.

[0:04:20 - 0:04:27]: So the final dough temperature is one of the most important things when making dough.

[0:04:27 - 0:04:33]: Obviously it needs to be smooth but it needs to be at temperature to set the fermentation

[0:04:33 - 0:04:40]: process off to a great start.

[0:04:40 - 0:04:45]: As most of you could tell this dough is visually very strong.

[0:04:45 - 0:04:55]: It has a great window pane and this is how to maximize the use of your mixer.

[0:04:55 - 0:04:56]: Now there you have it.

[0:04:56 - 0:04:59]: That's how to make beautiful dough in a spiral dough mixer.

[0:04:59 - 0:05:00]: Don't worry everybody.

[0:05:00 - 0:05:04]: I'm going to be your go to pizza man here on YouTube to show you the ins and outs on
